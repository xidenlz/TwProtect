# TwProtect
Application security matters, so I'm releasing this VMProtect script. It uses VMProtect scripting to increase security by XOR-ing functions, which is somewhat similar to LLVM. Just paste it into the VMProtect script section, and compile. It’s an older script, and I'm only releasing it since I’ve got something better now.

Byeee.
