# TwProtect
So since application security is important thing, i decided to release this VMProtection script, Yeah I'm using VMP scripting for more security, by XORING the functions, It's something similler to LLVM, just paste it on VMP script section and compile it, ofc it's old, I won't release something like this unless if i have better one


Byeee.
